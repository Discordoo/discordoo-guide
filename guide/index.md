# Discordoo Documentation
Welcome! This is documentation of Discordoo API in English language.

## WARNING
**THIS LIBRARY IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT!** All instructions for using the library will be written after the library is released.

## **Important!**
Discordoo and this documentation is intended to be used by people, who know what they do, can write/read some basic TypeScript/JavaScript and know how to work with Node.js runtime.
If you are a beginner, you should learn language and only after start learning Discordoo.

Of course, you may not learn TS/JS, however, you will not get any support on official support server.
The same is applied to those, who ask silly questions like "how do I answer to slash-commands?", "how do I ban a member?". Answers to these questions are in documentation.

**We will only help you on those questions, that are not answered in documentation.**. 
Or on questions, that are answered in documentation, but are hard to understand and are confusing.

## About documentation
Above, there are some sections which are dedicated to each part of the library. 

`Advanced guide` tab contains instructions about really hard things, like inter-machines sharding, understanding development process of Rest/Gateway/Cache providers, handling gateway events overloads etc.

`Base guide` tab contains instructions, most of which are needed for all Discord bots.

If you are just starting using Discordoo, check `Base guide`.

## About library
### I am already using eris/djs, why should I start using ddoo?
Discordoo is made {--because creator is tired of djs--} to make bot development more comfortable,
save servers' resources, provide safe ways for developers of big bots to work with gateway/rest and be easy to scale, as well as to create deep integration between developer and library.

#### Eris saves resources of my server and D.js is really comfortable to work with.
Eris is not as comfortable as djs and djs is not as fast as eris. Discordoo has both performance and comfortability. 
However, only Evan You can do magic, so eris is most performant of three, but ddoo isn't much slower.

### How to pronounce your library name?
Discordoo is pronounced like dɪskɔːdʊ. It can also be pronounced like `Discordo` with stress on last syllable[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLTqXW_Gvb0)

## About documentation, but not for developers.
This documentation is written by **developers** for **developers**. Prescriptivism is not our objective. Our objective is to explain **developer**, how to use the library. We won't listen to any complaints about `this sentence is hard to read and your documentation sucks!`. If you've found real mistakes in our documentation, we are happy to accept your amends. If you find mistakes like `this sentence sounds bad` and do not do anything, don't waste your time. `It sounds bad! Fix it yourself.` - doesn't help us at all.
