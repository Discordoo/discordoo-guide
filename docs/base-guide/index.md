# The Discordoo guide
Hi there! This is the Discordoo Guide(or the Guide in short). Here, you will
learn all the basics and internals of Discordoo.

On the left you can see steps. Each step introduces a new concept about the library.
If you do 2-3 steps a day, I bet that you will know Discordoo in less than a month.

## Important notice
This guide is intended to be read by people, who know TypeScript and Node.js on
beginner's level. We will not help you if you don't know how to use Node.js or
write basic TypeScript code.
