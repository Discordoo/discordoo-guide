# Installing Discordoo
In this step, you will know how to install Discordoo.

Discordoo is located under `discordoo` package and `@discordoo` organization.

## Let's start
First of all, you need to have a **node.js version 12.18** or higher. 
If you want to use typescript in your project, **typescript version must be 4.2.2** or higher.

### npm
Currently, our package is only available on npm. So, install it:
```shell
npm i discordoo
```

## Ecosystem
In addition to the main package, we have others: for example, you can use the discordoo collection separately without installing discordoo. In the future, we will have several additional packages that will help you develop your bots.

As I said above, the collection can be installed separately:
```shell
npm i @discordoo/collection
```
