# Discordoo Documentation
Hi there! This is the Discordoo documentation. Here you will learn all the basics and internals of Discordoo.

## Where to start?
If you are a beginner, go to the Guide tab. This is the most friendly place where you can learn how to work with Discordoo.

Or you can go to the Api tab, it contains a precise description for everything in Discordoo, but it is not intended for beginners.

## Important notice
This documentation is intended to be read by people, who know TypeScript and Node.js on beginner's level. We will not help you if you don't know how to use Node.js or write basic TypeScript code.
