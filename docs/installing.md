# Step 1 - Installing Discordoo
In this step, you will know how to install Discordoo.

Discordoo is hosted on npm and located under `discordoo` package. It contains the core of the library. However, it is
highly recommended to create a new project from zero.

To do it, execute the following script in a **new** directory:

```shell
$ npm init @discordoo
```

It will ask you some questions. After a few seconds of waiting you are done! You have Discordoo installed on your PC.

## Existing project
In case you have an existing project, you can install Discordoo separately. 

```shell
$ npm install discordoo
```

Congratulations! You have done step 1! More adventures are coming
